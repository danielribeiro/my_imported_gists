For each Ruby module/class, we have Ruby methods on the left and the equivalent
Clojure functions and/or relevant notes are on the right.

For clojure functions, symbols indicate existing method definitions, in the 
clojure namespace if none is explicitly given.  clojure.contrib.*/* functions can
be obtained from http://github.com/kevinoneill/clojure-contrib/tree/master,
ruby-to-clojure.*/* functions can be obtained from the source files in this
gist.

If no method symbol is given, we use the following notation:

[name] Ruby method is an alias for Ruby method [name], see that method
[Enum] Ruby method is also defined in Enumerable, see the equivalent there
des!   Ruby method is destructive, an alternative may be suggested
ni     Ruby method doesn't have a direct equivalent, an alternative may be given
uf     Ruby method is IMO an "unfeature", so no equivalent is given
lib    Ruby method is not fundamental to data structure, belongs in other lib

Right now we only have Enumerable and Array, though we hope to have Set, Hash,
and String/Regexp eventually.

Note that Clojure data structures and the associated sequence functions are
fundamentally different from the Ruby data structures and methods because the 
Clojure data structures are always persistent and most of the sequence functions
are lazy. You can get started on the Ruby => Clojure road with a guide like 
this, but to fully leverage Clojure you will need to understand persistence and
laziness.
